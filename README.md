# envman

## Who and for what?

- connect tools with each other : one tool saves an ENV, the other uses it (input & output)
- manage your environment-sets : use different ENVs for different projects


## How?


## TODO

- better command error handling
- store ENVs as Map, not as Slice/array
- better help texts
- **print**: should work for empty as well
